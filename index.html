    Today, I have been learning how to set up a server to host 
    my site(s).  Hopefully, I might get one up tonight.  If not 
    tonight then definitely by Saturday, 5/22/2021.
    <p>For whatever reason, this is not showing up in my github 
      now.  It might be due to github only network lag or a 
      github error in my opinion, if it was not my fault 
      somehow. 
    </p>
    <p>Looks like it was my error for not connecting to github 
      in the first place.  Ok, now I know that this will go down 
      as me being verbally self critical.
